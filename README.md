# Frontend AngularJS Starter App Boilerplate

This project is an application skeleton for a typical AngularJS web app serving the Frontend views and controllers. You can use it to quickly bootstrap your angular webapp projects and dev environment for these projects.

## Getting Started

- To get you started you can simply clone this repository and install the dependencies:
  `git clone https://github.com/flight846/angular1_boilerplate.git`
   `cd angular1_boilerplate`

- If you just want to start a new project without the angular-seed commit history then you can do:
  `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/flight846/angular1_boilerplate.git <your-project-name>`

- You will still need a backend like MEANJS, LAMP to communicate hook you server side controllers and models or make a service to call an API.
